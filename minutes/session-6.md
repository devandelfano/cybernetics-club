### Lecture Notes

###### [SLIDES 1-2]	
Inspiration for the talk: 

* **Hugh Lubberly** - Academic ([http://www.dubberly.com/]())
* **Paul Pangaro** - Practitioner

But together they have worked on a body of worked that has coalesced and they teach at Stanford under the Human Computer Interaction program.	

###### SLIDES 3-5]	
My work: thinking of product design as a cycle of [missed]
Now my goal is to think 3-5 years into the future. So now my practice is more experimental: interested in design fiction, stuff like Hugh’s work.

[systems exercise: everyone was writing systems on a sticky note and placing on the wall]	

###### [SLIDES 11-12]	
Observations from the exercise: 

* ways to think about low systems: systems that have opportunities for aesthetics (purely aesthetics).

###### [SLIDES 13-17]	
Clip from Paul Pangaro: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oad8Ro8j_fE]()

The word **cybernetics**: foundational, comes from the greek word meaning **“steering”**, but also fundamentally cybernetics has to do with goals and achieving goals. 

Important today because we’re creating these ‘automatic systems’. When people talk about AI and automated systems, we’re not talking about the technology itself we’re talking about the goals…

**Feedback** - can you imagine a world before the concept of feedback?
We’ve only had this formal idea of feedback for a very short time… [acting, sensing, comparing]….

###### [SLIDE 18]
Shows lipstick robot clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcW70-6eQcY](). But this examples has no acting, no sensing, no comparing.

###### [SLIDE 21-26]
Steering when you think of a goal and trying to steer towards that goal - as a boy scout when I was sailing, you can’t go directly into the wind. But if your course is at an oblique angle you have to ‘tack’. **‘tacking’** is about constant course correction. 

Fundamentals of cybernetics: aiming towards a **goal**, but the world always takes us off course of those goals. 
-measuring the distance between the current status and the goal (your error). Your system has to correct the error. 

Regulation, that’s the idea to think about. 

###### [SLIDE 27-29]
**Circularity** - you might think of this as detecting error, comparing with your goal, adjusting your rudder to correct and therefore the ship redirects its course. 

###### [SLIDE 30-]
Formal model that **Paul Pangaro** worked on [SLIDE 31]. Using the thermostat as the quintessential example. 
-Becomes a really useful model to describe systems. You could imagine GPS, or self-improvement through this model. 

**Requisite variety**: Means does your system have the ability to reach it’s goal. And example is the top right graph on [SLIDE 32].

###### [SLIDE 33] 
**Actuator**: has 1. resolution (??), 2. frequency (how frequent does it activate?), 3. range (will thermostat keep house between range I’ve set?).

Closing thoughts:	
One way to think of cybernetics: is to think of how to interact with machines.

###### [SLIDE 36]
**Don Norman’s** quote: there are things in this quote that make me think that Don has been exposed to cybernetics. 

###### [SLIDE 37]
1. Static vs. dynamic systems: dynamic is a system that can change over time
2. Linear or closed-loop: 
    1. Linear is the video we saw of the robot putting makeup on the girl.
    2. Closed-loop: ??
3. Order:
    1. First order loop: like the thermostat. 
    2. Second order loop: who is setting the goal in this thermostat? Think of modeling the government: you come up with a set of infinite loops.
4. Self-adjusting vs. learning

If I could write I’d write about how Aristotle got it wrong: there’s way more than 5 senses. (Francis: Senses can be separated from perception also…)

###### [SLIDE 39]
These are ways to think about feedback from a design perspective.  
We provide feedback to users so they can learn how to use the system

Motivation: what motivates someone to sell something? At Etsy, a lot of it is an intrinsic motivation of wanting to create something. Other people want to do what they do full time and quit their job. 

A lot of this work we’ve been discussing is pre-digital thinking… I have an intuition that we can add to this body of knowledge but in our digital age. 

If there are more than 5 senses… are we taking advantage of all the feedback we can get from the environment?

### Q&A

-How does cybernetics as a practice help you project into the future in your job?

* One way to think about Etsy is that we have these three components: acting, sensing, comparing… The other more important insight is that I think I can maneuver in a large organization much better because I understand these systems. It becomes very important when you want to build teams. My previous job involved building a UX practice from scratch - understanding those dynamics through that lens is really important. 

-I don’t have enough sensors. Our coworkers are very important sensors… Strategies around this involve increasing the number of your sensors, the resolutions of your sensors. Comparisons are about: are you measuring the right thing? Am I doing the right thing? 

-Is there a limit to how well we can understand these systems? What about the complexity of the system?

* You’re outside of the gates, you want to talk in a whole structure but you an only look at it through [?? missed]. Even though there are parts of a system that can be invisible to us, we can still examine some parts. Is there a limit? Probably, yes. 

-From the book "Thinking fast and slow", by Daniel Kahneman: multiplying two 2-digit numbers is easy in your head. Multiplying two 3-digit numbers is super hard. Gives you insight into the limits of our ability to hold complex thoughts in our head. 

-At Toyota: for any problem you have to ask five times “why?”. If you don’t have five levels you’re probably wrong.

-When might we not want to use cybernetics? Like in ethics or politics (i.e. a politician that just says I want to get elected, I’m going to apply cybernetics). In some situations, you might actually say: I’m not going to understand the system. 

* In behavioral motivation problem: you can do two things to get someone to do something: boost their motivation or boost their ability to do something. Can people do something and do people even care to do this? 
* Design ethics: maybe designers should take ethics too

-In book “Future Perfect” - talking about how the market self-regulates to signals…. 

-Our conversation of cybernetics is very much inspired by biology…

-Design for meta-design: this gives us a language for thinking about meta-design…. 

-Automating customer service through chat bots: i’m very close to research and inevitably any chat conversation starts with a long history of whatever led to a complaint. If we’re going to create smart, automated conversations with people how do we know what it could look like?

-What about when systems fail? (referenced talk by Kevin Slavin on systems: [https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world/transcript?language=en]() 

* You could swipe parts of the system in and out, you could set a different goal, understanding the subcomponents can help you assess failure.
* Paul taught us about wicked problems: is the problem even solvable? are there things that are too wicked for design to tackle? (Paper by Webber and Rittel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)
* But then what is a problem in the first place? We have no agreement on how to define problems?

-What kind of problems is everyone solving?

* In architecture: what you choose for your design and how that affects the user. You could trigger a whole complicated series of events… Often you rely on heuristics or design sense or rules of thumb. 
* Conversation about architecture, Trump tower, and politics?? Some people making decisions based on how they “feel”… [couldn’t hear too well here]

-Struggle with cybernetics because it’s too reductionist. Too technocratic. You might be dehumanizing all our very human systems. This abstraction as a technical object is problematic. Example of Brody Condon media artist…

-Relationship between ideology and cybernetics… Does it have a place in cybernetics. 

-The ethical designer: how do you establish your goal? Is it to be a good designer? Is it to deliver something of value to my user? Ethics being a cybernetics system...

-Then we played Melanie’s fantastic Beauty Contest!!! [http://beautycontest.melanie-hoff.com/](). 

* First round: winning number was 12, guessed by Susse!
* Second round: winning number was 6, guessed by “friend of the person above"
