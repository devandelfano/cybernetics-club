Some of the papers that Karla Hoff mentioned:

- [Familiarity Does _Not_ Breed Contempt: Diversity, Discrimination and Generosity in Delhi Schools](http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/familiarity_does_not._-_rao.pdf). When poor and rich students mixed, they picked each other based on skill for a relay race rather than discriminating based on social standing.
- [Soap Operas and Fertility: Evidence from Brazil](http://www.iadb.org/res/files/WP-633updated.pdf). A strong culture of soap operas in Brazil, which center around smaller families, may be responsible for the general decrease in family size in the country.
- [Coffee room eyes cause people to act more honestly](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9424-big-brother-eyes-make-us-act-more-honestly/).
- [Clientism in Indian Villages](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130623).

This is the World Development Report she worked on: [World Development Report 2015: Mind, Society, and Behavior](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2015).

Some important concepts in behavioral economics: anchoring, context, framing, etc - we tend to use recent or easily accessible information in making decisions even if they are totally unrelated to the decision we're making. For example, [price anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring).
