**Cybernetics Club** is a learning group organized around the legacy of cybernetics and all the fields it has touched.

"Cybernetics" is difficult to define: an ambitious interdisciplinary science that sought to connect fields as disparate as astrophysics, biology, sociology, computer science, and more by considering systems, and the control and communication that run within them, as the objects of study. As a practice, cybernetics is a victim of its own success -- it is renown has faded, but its ideas have dissolved into the disciplines it aimed to unite, or seeded entirely new ones: information science, systems biology, and more.

In a world that feels intractable in scale and complexity, tensions of communication and control abound. Maybe by returning to the ideas of cybernetics can we find some help in making sense of the present.

The ethos of Cybernetics Club is: "I'm interested in this topic, let's learn and explore it together". **Anyone can lead a session; there's no need to be an expert.** The only requirement is some connection to cybernetics, or approaching the topic in a cybernetic way. Fortunately, cybernetics is such a broad discipline that its framing is applicable to many, many different subjects.

We meet roughly every other month in New York. Remote participants are more than welcome.
