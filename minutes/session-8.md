-This discussion must begin with an exploration of the defining traits of what constitutes 'NRx'

- we all take a look at the diagram people find so interesting

- what is the goal of NRx
- what is the gripe with democracy
- CEO-metaphor ... the primary figure NRx folks tend to latch onto
- companies function in an incredibly optimized manner, towards a single goal

- what percentage of companies actually reach sustainable success?
compared to:
- what percentage of democracies are functioning 

the mapping of NRx corporate structuring to ... 

striving for utopia on both sides ... striving for unity on the left is much difficult from the grassroots perspective

Accelerationism readings would have helped to tie some readings together

The Left may have failed to offer a positive affect, w/r/t CA vs. ADA's methods of psychography 

2x2 for systems--ideals?

urbit - nick land connection ... life should be feudal, but you can leave whenever you want?

Alex preen article -- feedback loops: Trumps watching TV, feeds into him, which he feeds back into

NEET ... Incel ... methods of getting out of the responsibility of personal failures ... a delusion of inversion

is the right, by nature of its ideology, able to construct new realities in an easier way? is the left's collectivist nature hindering the creation of new realities?

Right Richter (as in Richter scale)

KEK ... cults ... creation of new realities 

insulation from effects that may harm other folks on the ground may be fueling some of the ability for people to seemingly create realities without repercussion.

it's not that trump had some clairvoyance in his poli strategy --- the electorate found trump as a strange unifier within an arena that otherwise had no cohesion

everything is wrestling -- article to check out

--

conspiracies as totalizing narratives ... sounds like capitalism ... the ultimate conspiracy

conspiracy theories are the poor man's method of handling with complexity

NRX cowboy mentality may only work well when individual cowboys are airdropped into positions of power.
